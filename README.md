# SpanishDict Extension
A simple extension that adds a context menu item to translate selected text with SpanishDict. 

## Install
This extension is not (yet) distributed through addons.mozilla.org. Instead you'll need to do a manual installation.
1. Go to the releases page and download the latest version (don't extract the contents (unless you want to check the code))
2. In Firefox, go to the addons page (copy `about:addons` into your address bar)
3. Click the gear wheel next to `Manage Your Extensions` and select `Install Add-on from File...`
4. Select the zip file you downloaded

Select some text on a web page and see the new context menu item for a quick translation!
